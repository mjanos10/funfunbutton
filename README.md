# FunFunButton

A NodeJs app that counts the number of button clicks and displays them, all without variables (well, kinda).

Deployed via ZEIT's Serverless Docker Beta.

[MPJ was doing this on his channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKFi3f_W33k) and I was just curious whether I could do it.

## TODO

- [ ] Add Server-Sent-Events for streaming
- [x] Remove function arguments
- [ ] Add pm2
