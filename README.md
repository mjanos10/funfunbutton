# FunFunButton

A NodeJs app that counts the number of button clicks and displays them, all WITHOUT VARIABLES (well, kinda).

Deployed via Serverless Docker Beta.

MPJ was doing this bit and I was just curious if I could do it.

## TODO

- Add Server-Sent-Events for streaming
- Remove function arguments
